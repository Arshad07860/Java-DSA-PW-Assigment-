Ques 6. What benefits come with using GIT?
Answer.It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy        for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source        projects.

Ques 7. What is a Git repository?
Answer. A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You         can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

Ques 8. How can you initialize a repository in Git?
Answer. The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an         existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.        Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this        is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.
